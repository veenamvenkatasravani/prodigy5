                <h2>VEENAM VENKATA SRAVANI</h2>
              <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Sravani, a passionate student with a keen interest in the dynamic 
                    world of web design.
                     My journey into web design began with a curiosity about how websites come to life. As a B.Tech student,
                      I found myself captivated by the intersection of technology and creativity. What started as a hobby soon turned into a deep-seated 
                      passion
                    I'm from Rajahmundry in East godavari district of Andhra pradesh,
                    I completed my schooling in Anand Nagar Muncipal High School and intermediate at Rajamahendri junior college.
                    Now i'm studing B.Tech 3nd year in Aditya college of engineering and technology. and i
                    dedicated and imaginative web designer with a love for crafting visually stunning and intuitively functional digital
                     experiences.
                     In the classroom and beyond, I've been building a foundation in web design, learning the ropes of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                      Proficient in design tools, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
                    Ever since I stumbled upon the captivating world of web design now , I've been hooked. The ability to blend artistry
                     with technology and create something that resonates with users is what fuels my passion.
                    Proficient in HTML, CSS, I bring technical expertise to the table. Combined with my flair for design using tools like 
                    Adobe Creative Suite, I create websites that not only look good but also provide a seamless user experience.
                    Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a bit better. </p>

                <p> hey!!!...I completed my schooling at Anand Nagar muncipal corparation high school in Rajahmundry.Schooling is a fundamental component
                     of the educational journey, serving as the cornerstone of a person's intellectual and social development. Beyond 
                     its primary role in imparting academic knowledge, schooling plays a crucial role in shaping individuals into 
                     well-rounded and informed members of society. It provides a structured environment where students not only acquire
                      essential skills in subjects such as mathematics, science, and language arts but also learn valuable life skills 
                      such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. Moreover, schooling fosters social
                       interactions, encouraging students to collaborate, share ideas, and develop interpersonal skills that are vital 
                       for their future .
